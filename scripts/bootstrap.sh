# neither the pod nor the key. Cloudflare fronts rest.runpod.io and answers "error code:
# 1010" (banned browser signature) to the DEFAULT Python User-Agent, and urllib sends
# `Python-urllib/3.11`. Proof, all from one machine, same key, same URL: urllib default
# UA -> 403, urllib with any other UA -> 404, curl -> 404, curl FORCED to
# `Python-urllib/3.11` -> 403. The laptop "it works from here" test used curl, which is
# why it looked like an inside-the-pod restriction. Hence the UA below — do not remove it.
# The ladder then tries GraphQL podTerminate (different host, same UA fix) and runpodctl,
# and NAMES whichever rung worked, so a future block shows up in the log as itself rather
# than as a mystery. None of it is load-bearing: scripts/reap_pods.sh deletes this pod
# from the laptop if every rung fails.
