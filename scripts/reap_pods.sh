# HOST-SIDE POD REAPER. Deletes pods whose run has FINISHED, from this laptop, so a run
# never depends on a pod being able to kill itself.
#
# Why this exists: from 2026-09-09 every DELETE a pod sent for itself came back 403, and
# this project wrote that off as "pods may not delete themselves". They may — the block
# was Cloudflare's 1010 on the default `Python-urllib/*` User-Agent, and bootstrap.sh now
# sends its own UA (see the TERMINATE block there). But the failure mode that exposed is
# permanent: when self-termination breaks for ANY reason, nothing notices, and the pod
#   1. bills forever — 20 idle shard pods are real money — and
#   2. blocks the next launch: launch.sh SKIPS a pod whose name is already up, so the
#      next daily silently never runs.
# A pod cannot be trusted to clean up after itself, so this does it from the host.
#
# It deletes a pod only after reading that pod's OWN log off the volume and seeing the
# run finish — the `work=<rc> (…) — terminating pod <id>` line bootstrap.sh prints AFTER
# the run, the strategy pass and the Mongo publish. `run exit=` is NOT enough: minutes of
# publishing still follow it. Older pods that predate that line are recognised by their
# `!! TERMINATION NOT CONFIRMED` tail instead.
#   Any exit code is reaped by default: the work is over either way and the log is already
#   on the volume, so there is nothing left on the pod to look at. A non-zero code is
#   reported loudly; --keep-failed holds those pods instead (they then block a relaunch of
#   the same shard, so clear them with --force once you are done reading).
#   KEEP_POD=1 pods are never reaped (launch.sh passes it through; it means "I am
#   inspecting this one").
#   A pod with no log on this volume is never reaped.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/reap_pods.sh                      # one pass: report every pod, reap the finished ones
#   scripts/reap_pods.sh --watch              # keep polling (default: until --deadline, 9h)
#   scripts/reap_pods.sh --watch --until-empty    # …and stop once no pods are left
#   scripts/reap_pods.sh --dry-run            # report only, delete nothing
#   scripts/reap_pods.sh --keep-failed        # leave pods whose run exited non-zero up
#   scripts/reap_pods.sh s3 s7                # restrict to these pods (name fragment or id)
#   scripts/reap_pods.sh --force 3tkh6tp97rh5x4   # delete these ids without reading a log
#
# Launch a run and forget about it:
#   RUN_MODE=daily SHARDS=1 bash scripts/launch.sh
#   nohup scripts/reap_pods.sh --watch --until-empty > /tmp/reap.log 2>&1 &
